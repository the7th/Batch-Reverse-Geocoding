if you want to batch reverse geocoding, you can use this. you can get as much address as you want from a given latitude and longitude. Get both name and address from latitude and longitude listed in the page. Useful if you only want to do one-off batch reverse geocoding. 

Will improvize the messy code of mine bit by bit :D
